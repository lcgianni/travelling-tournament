Approximation Algorithm with LKH solver

** Python 2.7 with Numpy is required to run this program **

1) Place modified* symmetrical distance matrix AND original version in the same directory as LKH_approximation_algorithm.py
   and name them accordingly (see examples)

2) Do not modify files parameters.txt and output.txt

3) Double click LKH_approximation_algorithm.py

4) Type file name of modified distance matrix (e.g. nl8)

5) Type number of teams (e.g. 8)


* Check current files as an example of the necessary modifications
