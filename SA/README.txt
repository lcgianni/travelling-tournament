Simulated Annealing

** Python 2.7 with Numpy is required to run this program **

1) Place symmetrical distance matrix in the same directory as simulated_annealing.py

2) Double click simulated_annealing.py

3) Type file name of distance matrix (e.g. nl8)

4) Edit Simulated Annealing variables (e.g. initial temperature) directly on code (e.g. open simulated_annealing.py as a text file)
