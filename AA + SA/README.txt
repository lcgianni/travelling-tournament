Simulated Annealing with Approximation Algorithm

** Python 2.7 with Numpy is required to run this program **

1) Place symmetrical distance matrix AND solution provided by the program in JAVA (folder AA) 
   in the same directory as approximation_algorithm_and_simulated_annealing.py and name them accordingly (see examples)

2) Double click approximation_algorithm_and_simulated_annealing.py

3) Type file name of distance matrix (e.g. nl8)

4) Edit Simulated Annealing variables (e.g. initial temperature) directly on code (e.g. open approximation_algorithm_and_simulated_annealing.py as a text file)
