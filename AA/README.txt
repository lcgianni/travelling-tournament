Approximation Algorithm

** JAVA 1.6 or later is required to run this program **

1) Place symmetrical distance matrix in the same directory as TSP.class and part2.class.

2) Execute TSP.class using command prompt as follows "java TSP".

3) Type full file name of city distance matrix (including .txt).

4) Enter an integer parameter for maximum consecutive home/away games.

5) The algorithm will first find a solution to the TSP and display the best path it has found.  The tournament schedule will display along with each team's tour distance and the total distance traveled by all teams.  

6) A file "Solution [input file name].txt" will be created in the same directory with the team schedule output.
